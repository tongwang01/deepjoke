However, you can choose whose place you want to take.\\n\\n'Oh, that sounds okay I guess' says Bush.\\n\\nSatan leads him to the first room and opens the door. In this room, there's a huge swimming pool. In it, Reagan is drowning. He goes down, then up, then down, then up, and he's gasping for air all the while.\\n\\n'Oh, no,' says Bush. 'That's not for me, I'm a poor swimmer.'\\n\\nSatan opens the second door. The room is full of rocks and they see Nixon trying to break up the rocks with a wooden hammer.\\n\\n'Nah, I have problems with my shoulders and my back, that'd be such a painful thing to do day after day.'\\n\\nSo Satan opens the third door. In the room, they see Clinton lying on the floor, all tied up. Monica Lewinsky is lying on top of Clinton, giving him a blowjob. Bush stares at the scene with a wide smile and says:\\n\\n'Ah, that I could endure!'\\n\\n'Alright,' laughs Satan. 'Monica, you're free to go!'</td>\n",

       "1686    I've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.\\n\\nAnd I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.\\n\\nFor example… One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.\\n\\nWell, the passion started to heat up, but then she said \"I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.\"\\n\\nI said \"WHAT??!! What was that?!\"\\n\\nSo she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...\"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.\"\\n\\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, \"Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?\"\\n\\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\\n\\nThe very next day, I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.\\n\\nLet me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, \"That's fine, honey.\"\\n\\nShe appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, \"I think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.\"\\n\\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, \"No honey, I don't feel like it.\"\\n\\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, \"WHAT?\"\\n\\nI then said \"Honey, I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.\\n\\nYou're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.\"\\n\\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, \"Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?\"\\n\\nApparently, no sex tonight either!\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: Didn't expect to make front page but glad lots of you got a laugh out of it!\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold!    \n",

He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering.\\nThe devil was dumbfounded. \"I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy. What is wrong with you two?\"\\n\\nThe Michiganders look at the devil in surprise. \"Well, don't ya know - if hell froze over, that must mean.

He asks him to explain the difference between the words realistically and potentially. \\n\\nHis father responds by telling him to go ask his mother if she would sleep with their neighbour, Brett, for a million dollars. He then told him to also ask his sister whether she would sleep with their neighbour, Brett, for a million dollars. And he also told him to ask his brother whether he would sleep with Brett for a million dollars. \\n\\nThe kid asks everyone. He comes back and tells his dad that they all said yes. \\n\\nHis father responds that potentially, we're sitting on 3 million dollars.

I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.\\n\\nWhen the highway patrolman came on the scene he could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her and saw her near fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.\\n\\nThen the patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me and said, 'how are you feeling?'\\n\\nNow what the fuck would you say?\"\\n\\nEdit: wow not only is this my first post over 100 but it's front page and some kind hearted financier hath gilded this lowly pleb.

You take only a teaspoon and then say '1-2-3'.\" When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life and you can perform as long as you  want.\"     \\n\\nThe man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, \"How do I stop the medicine from working?\"   \\n\\n\"Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'\" the medicine man responded, \"but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.\"     \\n\\nThe man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he quickly took off his clothes and said, \"1-2-3!\" Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes as she asked \"What was the 1-2-3 for?\"      \\n\\nAnd that, boys and girls, is why we should never end our sentences with a preposition, because we could end up with a dangling participle.   \n",

On one such occasion, a ringing slap is heard and as the train passes back into daylight, the Frenchman is rubbing his sore, red cheek.\\nThe brunette thinks 'I bet that dirty Frenchman fondled the blonde and she struck the pervert.'\\nThe blonde thinks 'I bet that filthy Frenchman was looking to grope me in the dark, mistook the dowdy brunette for me and she slapped the beast.'\\nThe Frenchman thinks 'I bet that perfidious Englishman touched up the blonde in the dark and she slapped me by mistake.'\\nThe Englishman thinks 'I can't wait for another tunnel so I can slap that French twat again.'   \n",

See, you're on my list, but I have no free rooms for you. But you, you definitely have to stay in hell, so I'll have to find a solution. There are a few people here who aren't as bad as you are... I guess I'll let one go and you'll take their place. However, you can choose whose place you want to take.\\n\\n'Oh, that sounds okay I guess' says Bush.\\n\\nSatan leads him to the first room and opens the door. In this room, there's a huge swimming pool. In it, Reagan is drowning. He goes down, then up, then down, then up, and he's gasping for air all the while.\\n\\n'Oh, no,' says Bush. 'That's not for me, I'm a poor swimmer.'\\n\\nSatan opens the second door. The room is full of rocks and they see Nixon trying to break up the rocks with a wooden hammer.\\n\\n'Nah, I have problems with my shoulders and my back, that'd be such a painful thing to do day after day.'\\n\\nSo Satan opens the third door. In the room, they see Clinton lying on the floor, all tied up. Monica Lewinsky is lying on top of Clinton, giving him a blowjob. Bush stares at the scene with a wide smile and says:\\n\\n'Ah, that I could endure!'\\n\\n'Alright,' laughs Satan. 'Monica, you're free to go!'   \n",

He's going through his usual run of silly blonde jokes when a big blonde woman in the fourth row stands on her chair and says,\\n\"OK jerk, I've heard just about enough of your denigrating blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What do a person's physical attributes have to do with their worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in my community, of reaching my full potential as a person... \\nbecause you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes but women at large... all in the name of humor.\" \\nFlustered, the ventriloquist begins to apologize, when the blonde pipes up, \"You stay out of this mister, I'm talking to that little jerk on your knee!\"</td>\n",

They quickly devised a good plan and they put their plan to action. \\nThe brunette drove up to the front of the bank that they had decided to rob. She turned to the blonde and asked her, \"Now, do you remember what the plan is?\" The blonde sighed and replied, \"Yeah, yeah, I remember...\" The brunette went over the plan once more and let the blonde out to do her stuff. \\n\\nBefore the blonde could shut the door, the brunette yelled out, \"Be sure to be in and out in no more than 5 minutes!\" The blonde ran inside and the brunette waited in the car... and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. After waiting for so long in the car, the blonde bursts out of the bank's doors, the alarm blaring loud enough to wake everyone up. The blonde was lugging a bank safe behind her by a rope tied around it. A security guard ran out of the bank, his pants down around his ankles and attempting to reach his gun. The blonde breathed heavily as she tried to put the safe in the car but finally just gave up and dropped the safe behind. She ran into the passenger seat and pulled the door shut, the car already moving. The security guard yelled, \"Stop! Stop!\" while the pair drove off, leaving the safe with rope tied tightly around it behind. The brunette frantically asked the blonde, \"What the hell happened in there?!?\" The blonde was panting and turned to the brunette and choked out, \"What do you mean? I followed the plan exactly!\" \\nThe brunette paused and yelled, \"YOU IDIOT! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TIE UP THE GUARD AND BLOW THE SAFE!\"   \n",

The brunette walks up to the bartender and says, \"Hey give me an ML.\" The bartender nods his head and hands her a Miller Lite. Following her, the redhead walks up to the bartender and says, \"I'd like a BL.\" Giving her a nod, the bartender pulls up a Bud Lite. Last, the blonde walks up to the bartender and says, \"Give me a Fifteen.\" \"A Fifteen?\" the bartender replies, \"What the hell is that?\" \"Oh, you know,\" the blonde says, \"A Seven and Seven.\"   \n",

You will find all the stuff in the garage.\" The girl says, \"O.K., How much will you pay me?\" The man says, \"How much does fifty bucks sound?\" The blonde quickly agrees and get straight to work. The wife who had heard the conversation inside says, \"50 bucks, I hope she knows the porch goes all around the house!\" 25 minutes later the girl knocks on the door and says, \"O.K. I am done. Can I have my money now?\" Surprised the man replies, \"O.K. Let me get the money\" He comes back and the girl says as she is leaving, \"By the way, it's a Ferrari, not a Porch!\"   \n",

God tells a joke, the brunette laughs and goes to hell. Then on the 2,000th step God tells a joke, the redhead laughs and goes to hell. On the 3,000th step God tells a joke, the blonde doesn't laugh and proceeds to the gate. Suddenly, she bursts out laughing.

They bark all day and all night, and I can't get a wink of sleep.\"\"I have good news for you,\" the doctor answered, rummaging through a drawer full of sample medications. \"Here are some new sleeping pills that work like a dream. A few of these and your trouble will be over.\"\"Great,\" the blond answered, \"I'll try anything. Let's give it a shot.\"A few weeks later the blond returned, looking worse than ever. \"Doc, your plan is no good. I'm more tired than before!\"\"I don't understand how that could be\", said the doctor, shaking his head. \"Those are the strongest pills on the market!\"\"That may be true,\" answered the blond wearily, \"but I'm still up all night chasing those dogs and when I finally catch one it's hard getting him to swallow the pill!\"   \n",
       "16  Three blondes were all applying for the last available position on the Highway Patrol. The detective conducting the interview looked at the 3 of them and said, \"So ya'll want to be a cop, eh?\"The blondes all nodded. The detective got up, opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder. Sitting back down, he opened it up and withdrew a picture, and said, \"To be a detective, you have to be able to detect. You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars, etc.\"So he stuck the photo in the face of the 1st blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds. \"Now, he said, \"did you notice any distinguishing features about the man?\"The blonde immediately said, \"Yes, I did. He has only one eye!\"The detective shook his head and said, \"Of course he has only one eye in this picture! It's a profile of his face! You're dismissed!\"The 1st blonde hung her head and walked out of the office. The detective then turned to the 2nd blonde, stuck the photo in her face for 2 seconds, pulled it back and said, \"What about you? Notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man?\"\"Yes! He only has one ear!\"The detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed, \"Didn't you hear what I just told the other lady? This is a profile of the man's face! Of course you can only see one ear!! You're excused, too!\"The 2nd blonde sheepishly walked out of the office. The detective turned his attention to the 3rd and last blonde and said, \"This is probably a waste of time, but.......\" He flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it, saying \"All right. Did you notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man?\"The blonde said, \"I did. This man wears contact lenses.\"The detective frowned, took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder. He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said, \"You're absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts... How in the world could you tell that by looking at this picture?\"The blonde rolled her eyes and said, \"Well duh! With only one eye and one ear, he certainly can't wear glasses!\"   \n",

The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains\" I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and vice-versa.\" Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, \"Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer that you'll ask me, I will pay you $500!.\" Figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match. This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. \"What's the distance from the earth to the moon?\" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches in to her purse, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: \"What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?\" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references.He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mails to all his coworkers and friends he knows. All to no avail. Afterover an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $500. The blonde politely takes the $500 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, \"Well, so what IS the answer!?\" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.   \n",

The man walked up to the blonde's car and asked, \"Are you going to Sydney?\"\"Sure,\" answered the blonde, \"do you need a lift?\"\"Not for me. I'll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. My problem is I've got two chimpanzees in the back which have to be delivered to Taronga Park Zoo. They're a bit stressed already so I don't want to keep them on the road all day. Could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? I'll give you fifty dollars for your trouble.\"\"I'd be happy to,\" said the blonde.So the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde's car and carefully strapped into their seat belts. Off they went.Five hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of Sydney when suddenly he was horrified. There was the blonde walking down the street and holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of the crowd.With a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde.\"What the hell are you doing here?\" he demanded, \"I gave you fifty dollars to take these chimpanzees to the zoo.\"\"Yes, I know you did,\" said the blonde, \"but just as we arrived it looked like it was going to rain so we decided to see a movie instead.\"   \n",

So he goes and tells them he wants to lose 5 kg. They strip him and lead him into a huge gym with all kinds of ropes and parallel bars and ladders and tell him to wait a minute. He's standing there when on the far side of the gym a door opens and out steps a gorgeous blonde, stark naked, with a sign saying \"If you catch me, I'm yours.\" He starts running, and just as he gets close, she starts picking up speed. Before he knows it, he's running all over the gym, up the ladders, down the ladders, across the parallel bars, here and there. And just as he's about to catch the blonde, pop, she disappears through a door. In comes the management who lead him to the showers, and then weigh him. Sure enough, he lost exactly 5 kg. He's back on the street and starts to think. \"Jesus, I was so close to catching her. If I had a little more time...\" So he races back to the gym and says, \"I want to lose 20 more kg.\" \"No problem,\" says the manager. Again he strips, and is led to the large gym. This time he's standing by the door when it opens. Out comes a gorilla with a sign \"If I catch you, you're mine.\"   \n",

The blonde suddenly had to go to the bathroom. She went into the woods with her toilet paper and did her business. While she was gone, the brunette and the redhead decided to play a joke on her. They skinned a rabbit and snuck up on the blonde, put the guts behind her and ran back to the campsite. Three minutes later they heard a scream. Then they waited another half an hour and the blonde came back, sweating. She said, \"I had to poop so hard I pooped my guts out. But with the grace of God and these two fingers, I think I got them back in.\"   \n",

I'll do anything to get a message to her.\" The clerk replies \"Anything?\". \"Yes.... ANYTHING!\" replies the blonde. He leads her back to his office and closes the door. He tells her to kneel in front of him. \"Unzip me...\" She does. \"Take it out..... go ahead.\" She does this as well. She looks up at him, his member in her hands and he says \"Well... go ahead... do it...\" She brings her lips close to it and shouts \"Hello?... Mom?\"   \n",

She went to a local park, grabbed a little boy, took him behind a tree and wrote this note: I have kidnapped your child. Leave $10,000 in a plain brown bagbehind the big oak tree in the park tomorrow by 7 AM.Signed - \"The Blonde\"She pinned the note inside the boy's jacket and told him to go straight home. The next morning, she returned to the park to find the $10,000 ina brown bag, behind the big oak tree, just as she had instructed. Alsoinside the bag was the following note: \"Here is your money. I cannot believe that one blonde would dothis to another.\"   \n",

He says, excuse me miss, but this is my seat. She replies, I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I have a great body and I'm going to Florida. So the guy calls the stewardess over to help him. He explains the situation to the stewardess, and the stewardess says, miss, your seat is in coach, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave first class. The blonde response, I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I have a  great body, and I'm going to Florida. The stewardess then goes to get the captain to help her, and the captain asks the blonde to please leave first class, and go back to coach.  The blonde response, I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I have a great body, and I'm going to Florida. The captain thinks about this for a minute, then whispers something in  the blondes ear. As soon as he does, she gets up and goes back to  coach.. The stewardess is amazed. What did you say?  The captain replies, I told her first class doesn't go to Florida.   \n",

Firemen are on the street below, holding a blanket for them to jump in. The firemen yell to the Brunette, \"Jump! Jump! It's your only chance to survive!\" The Brunette jumps and SWISH! The firemen yank the blanket away...the Brunette slams into the sidewalk like a tomato. \"C'mon! Jump! You gotta jump!' say the firemen to the Redhead. \"Oh no! You're gonna pull the blanket away!\" says the Redhead. \"No! It's Brunettes we can't stand! We're OK with Redheads!\" \"OK\" says the Redhead, and she jumps. SWISH! The firemen yank the blanket away, and the lady is flattened on the pavement like a pancake. Finally, the Blonde steps to the edge of the roof. Again, the firemen yell \"Jump! You have to jump!\" \"No way! You're just gonna pull the blanket away!\" yelled the Blonde. \"No! Really! You have to jump! We won't pull the blanket away!\" \"Look,\" the Blonde says. \"Nothing you say is gonna convince me that you're not gonna pull the blanket away! So what I want you to do is put the blanket down, and back away from it....\"   \n",

When she arrived at the place, the man said \"Well, there's only one helicopter here, and it only has one seat, if I show you how to do it, do you mind going up solo?\" \"Oh of course! I can handle it\" the blonde replied. Well, he showed her the inner-workings of the helicopter and sent her on her way, only asking that she radio in every 400ft. just to make sure everything was going smoothly. at 400ft, she radioed in saying \"wow! this is so much fun!\" At 800 ft. She radioed in again saying \"this is pretty easy, I can do this all day!\" At 1200 ft. She didnt. he waited and waited, and didn't hear from the blonde! seconds later he heard a crash in the field next to the station. He ran out to see what happened, the blonde crashed! Luckily she survived, \"what happened?\" he exclaimed. \"Well, I was doing fine, but, I started to get cold, so I just turned off the big fan!\"   \n",

She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.After becoming very frustrated with the \"no haggle\" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, \"Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!\"The shopkeeper said, \"By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!\" Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.Later in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he saw a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank. Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in amazement. Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouts out, \"Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!\"   \n",

She lets him in and shows him where she has the puzzles spread all over the table. He studies the pieces for a moment, then looks at the box. He turns to her and says, \"First of all, no matter what we do, we're not going to be able to assemble these pieces into anything resembling a tiger. Second, I'd advise you to relax. Let's have a cup of coffee, then put all these Frosties back in the box.\"   \n",

She climbed on top of a horse, and all of a sudden it started moving. She was a little frightened, this was her first time, but she kept on the horse.

He's going through his usual run of silly blonde jokes when a big blonde woman in the fourth row stands on her chair and says,\\n\"OK jerk, I've heard just about enough of your denigrating blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What do a person's physical attributes have to do with their worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in my community, of reaching my full potential as a person... \\nbecause you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes but women at large... all in the name of humor.\" \\nFlustered, the ventriloquist begins to apologize, when the blonde pipes up, \"You stay out of this mister, I'm talking to that little jerk on your knee!\"   \n",

He wouldn't do that so he was \\nfaced with either losing his job or leaving \\nhis cat.  \\n\\nFinally he decided to trust his brother with \\nthe cat for the week he would be gone.  He \\ngave Richard detailed instructions, schedules,\\nfood, etc. Finally he flew to London and \\ncalled Richard every few hours to make sure \\nGracie the cat was ok. 4 days of this went by\\nand John was really getting to be a pain in the \\nneck. \\n\\nOn the fifth day when he called, John asked \\nRichard how Gracie was and Richard told him. \\n\"Gracie is dead!\"  Well as you can imagine,\\nJohn nearly had a heart attack.  \\n\\nWhen he recovered he said to Richard, \"that was \\nthe most cruel thing I ever heard.  You know \\nhow much I loved that cat, why couldn't you \\nhave broken it to me gently. You know like when\\nI called said something like, 'well she's OK but \\nshe is up on the roof.' And then when I called \\nthe next time, tell me 'oh oh, bad news, she \\nfell off the roof and she's at the vets'. And\\nthen the next time break the news that she \\npassed away. At least I would have been a little \\nprepared for the bad news.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you are right John. I am sorry for being \\nso heartless.\"\\n\\nJohn accepted Richard's apology for being so \\nuncaring, and then said, \"oh, by the way, how's \\nMother?\"\\n\\nRichard then said, \"well, John, she's OK, but she's \\non the roof!\"</td>\n",

He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave. The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked a middle aged man named Moishe to represent them. Moishe asked for one addition to the debate. To make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed. The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.\" An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\" Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. \"What happened?\" they asked. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\" \"Yes, yes,.. and then???\" asked the crowd. \"I don't know,\" said Moishe, \"He took out his lunch, and I took out mine.\"</td>\n",

So he asked Pierre, \"How do you manage to attract all the girls and I attract no one?\" Pierre said, \"Take a potato and tuck it in your swimming costume, it drives the women wild.\" So the Irishman stuffed a potato in his costume and paraded up and down the beach. After a great many hours, however, he still failed to arouse a woman.

He wouldn't do that so he was \\nfaced with either losing his job or leaving \\nhis cat.  \\n\\nFinally he decided to trust his brother with \\nthe cat for the week he would be gone.  He \\ngave Richard detailed instructions, schedules,\\nfood, etc. Finally he flew to London and \\ncalled Richard every few hours to make sure \\nGracie the cat was ok. 4 days of this went by\\nand John was really getting to be a pain in the \\nneck. \\n\\nOn the fifth day when he called, John asked \\nRichard how Gracie was and Richard told him. \\n\"Gracie is dead!\"  Well as you can imagine,\\nJohn nearly had a heart attack.  \\n\\nWhen he recovered he said to Richard, \"that was \\nthe most cruel thing I ever heard.  You know \\nhow much I loved that cat, why couldn't you \\nhave broken it to me gently. You know like when\\nI called said something like, 'well she's OK but \\nshe is up on the roof.' And then when I called \\nthe next time, tell me 'oh oh, bad news, she \\nfell off the roof and she's at the vets'. And\\nthen the next time break the news that she \\npassed away. At least I would have been a little \\nprepared for the bad news.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you are right John.

       "2717  About a century or two ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave Rome. Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community. So the Pope made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave. The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked a middle aged man named Moishe to represent them. Moishe asked for one addition to the debate. To make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed. The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.\" An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\" Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. \"What happened?\" they asked. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\" \"Yes, yes,.. and then???\" asked the crowd. \"I don't know,\" said Moishe, \"He took out his lunch, and I took out mine.\"   \n",

So he asked Pierre, \"How do you manage to attract all the girls and I attract no one?\" Pierre said, \"Take a potato and tuck it in your swimming costume, it drives the women wild.\" So the Irishman stuffed a potato in his costume and paraded up and down the beach. After a great many hours, however, he still failed to arouse a woman. So the Irishman went to see Pierre again and said, \"I've tried it Pierre, it doesn't work!\" Pierre took one look at the Irishman and said, \"You might try putting the potato in the front of your bathing suit!\"   \n",

Now, since you've got me in a good mood, I'll be generous and give you a choice of three places in which you'll be locked up forever.\" Satan takes Bill to a huge lake of fire in which millions of poor souls are tormented and tortured. He then takes him to a massive coliseum where thousands of people are chased about and devoured by starving lions. Finally, he takes Bill to a tiny room in which there is a beautiful young blonde with an alluring look on her face, sitting at a table on which there is a bottle of the finest wine. To Bill's delight, he sees a PC in the corner. Without hesitation, Bill says \"I'll take this option.\" \"Fine,\" says Satan, allowing Bill to enter the room. Satan locks the room after Bill. As he turns around, he bumps into Lucifer. \"That was Bill Gates!\" cried Lucifer. \"Why did you give him the best place of all?\" \"That's what everyone thinks,\" snickered Satan. \"The bottle has a hole in it and the girl hasn't.\" \"What about the PC?\" \"It's got Windows 95!\" laughed Satan. \"And it's missing three keys.\" \"Which three?\" \"Control, Alt and Delete.\"   \n",

He spent the whole evening there, and arrived home very drunk around midnight each night.\\n\\nHe always had trouble getting his key into the keyhole and getting the door opened. His wife, waiting up for him, would go to the door and let him in. Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out, and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry continued his nightly routine.\\n\\nOne day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior, and was particularly distraught by it all.\\n\\nThe friend listened to her, and then said, \"Why don't you treat him a little differently, when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words, and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways.\"\\n\\nThe wife thought that might be a good idea.\\n\\nThat night, Harry took off again, after dinner. And, about midnight, he arrived home, in his usual condition.\\n\\nHis wife heard him at the door, and quickly went to it, and opened the door, and let Harry in.\\n\\nThis time, instead of berating him, as she had always done, she took his arm, and led him into the living room. She sat him down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him, and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to him, \"It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed, now, don't you think?\"\\n\\nAt that, Harry replied, in his inebriated state, \"I guess we might as well. I'll be getting in trouble with the stupid wife when I get home anyway!\"   \n",
